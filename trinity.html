<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. Trinity is a prestigous school that is very rigorous. It is a liberal arts school that places focus on a wide range experiential learning, and other learnings of that nature. The school exhibits a balance between the strong support of modern innovation while maintaining old traditions. To be accepted, you need to exceled in academics at your past institutions. The university is very strongly regarded when it comes to the STEM fields.</p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="tRINITY-CAMPUS.png"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> Trinity has large facilities for a smaller school. The largest builing on campus is the Center for Sciences and Innovation building. There's a large amount of staff assigned to provide resources or support to students. Here at Trinity students stay on campus until their Senior Year of school. This allows students to become very close to their peers and be able to access all the resources available to them on campus very easily. Lower Campus also features the Athletic Facilities, which inludes the Bell Athletic Center (available to all students), the baseball field, the football stadium, the softball field, the soccer stadium, the tennis stadium, intramural sports fields, and etc.   </p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the small campus feel. It allows to develop 1-on-1 relationships with our professors more easily, as well as make our peers feel more like family. I love the rigor of the courses, as odd as it sounds, because it makes me feel like I'm learning which is what college is about. I also love the views seen on upper campus of downtown San Antonio. </p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because of the high academic standards that exist at this institution. I also chose Trinity because a degree from this University is well recognized when looking to advance whether it be a job, or for an application to graduate school. The baseball team here as well is one of the top programs in Division 3 baseball.</p>
<p>I am majoring in Biology because I want to move on to medical school and become an orthopedic surgeon. A degree in Biology here at Trinity will allow me to achieve these goals. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
